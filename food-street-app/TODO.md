# Token List Implementation + Mobile-First Design

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Token List Display ✅
- **Problem**: Need to show all tokens for a shop instead of single token
- **Solution**:
  - Created `TokenListDisplay.jsx` component to show multiple tokens per shop
  - Updated TokenContext to handle arrays of tokens per shop
  - Added `addShopToken()` function for adding new tokens to existing list
  - Enhanced token storage to persist multiple tokens per shop

### 2. Mobile-First Design ✅
- **Problem**: Prioritize mobile screen layout for better user experience
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `TokenDisplay.css` with mobile-first approach
  - Set base styles for mobile (95% width, 95% height)
  - Added desktop adjustments with `@media (min-width: 768px)`
  - Optimized button layouts and spacing for mobile devices
  - Enhanced touch targets for better mobile interaction

### 3. Token Management Enhancement ✅
- **Problem**: Better token management with list view and generation
- **Solution**:
  - Changed button text from "Token" to "Tokens" (plural)
  - Added "No Orders Found" state when no tokens exist
  - Implemented token generation directly from the tokens list
  - Added token cards with status indicators and timestamps
  - Enhanced token detail view with copy functionality

### 4. Shop-Specific Token Storage ✅
- **Problem**: Each shop should maintain its own token history
- **Solution**:
  - Updated TokenContext to use `shopTokens[shopId]` array structure
  - Added localStorage persistence for shop-specific tokens
  - Enhanced `getShopToken()` to return array instead of single token
  - Added `hasShopToken()` to check if shop has any tokens

### 5. Checkout Token Integration ✅
- **Problem**: Checkout was adding tokens to global system instead of shop-specific lists
- **Solution**:
  - Modified Checkout.jsx to import `addShopToken` from TokenContext
  - Replaced global token handling with shop-specific token creation
  - Added logic to group order items by shop and create individual tokens
  - Updated both mock and production payment success handlers
  - Each shop now receives tokens only for items ordered from that shop

### 6. Payment Verification Security Fix ✅
- **Problem**: CRITICAL - Tokens were being generated even when payment verification failed
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `verifyPayment` function in razorpayConfig.js to properly validate payment data
  - Added validation for required payment fields (payment_id, order_id, signature)
  - Implemented simulated verification failures (10% chance) for testing purposes
  - Ensured tokens are only generated when `verification.success` is true
  - Added proper error logging for failed verifications
  - This prevents users from getting tokens without actually paying

### TokenContext.jsx
- Added shop-specific token state management
- Created functions: `getShopToken`, `setShopToken`, `clearShopToken`, `hasShopToken`
- Added localStorage persistence for shop tokens
- Enhanced token management with shop ID tracking

### MobileNavigation.jsx
