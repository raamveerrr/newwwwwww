# Token and Cart Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart not clearing after payment ✅
- **Problem**: Cart was not being cleared immediately after successful payment
- **Solution**:
  - Added `clearCart()` call in Cart.jsx `handleOrderSuccess` function
  - Enhanced CartContext.jsx `clearCart()` function to also clear localStorage immediately
  - Added console logging for debugging cart clearing
  - Removed restriction allowing multiple orders (users can place multiple orders)

### 2. Token generation and storage ✅
- **Problem**: Token should be generated in "My Tokens" section, not cart
- **Solution**:
  - Verified that `setNewOrder()` is called in Checkout.jsx after payment
  - Token is properly stored in TokenContext and accessible via "My Tokens" button
  - Added prevention of multiple checkouts when active order exists

### 3. Beautiful dialog positioning ✅
- **Problem**: Token dialog should appear in center, not random places
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced TokenDisplay.css with proper centering using flexbox
  - Added backdrop-filter blur effect for better visual appeal
  - Maintained high z-index (10000) to ensure dialog appears on top
  - Added smooth animation for dialog appearance

## Changes Made

### Cart.jsx
- Added `useToken` hook import
- Added check for active orders before allowing checkout
- Added `clearCart()` call in `handleOrderSuccess`
- Added `clearCart` to destructured useCart hook

### CartContext.jsx
- Enhanced `clearCart()` function with console logging
- Added immediate localStorage removal for better persistence

### Checkout.jsx

### TokenDisplay.css
- Added backdrop-filter blur effect to overlay
- Maintained proper centering with flexbox
- Kept high z-index for proper layering
